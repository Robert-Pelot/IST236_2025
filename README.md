Week 1: 1/5/25 - 1/11/25
     First:  this is just a short sample program - that opens up a port on the local host terminal.  It 
     was a test of 'how to' program the local host
     
     Second:  this is a duplicate of First - just done to be sure that the whole theory was understood.

     StickerSmash:  this was a personal project just testing functionality again.
     
Week 2: 1/12/25 - 1/18/25

     My First App was written alongside instructor video Mobile App Development - React Native App First Look - 2024
          It required some alterations regarding how it was written and the folders.  Primarily - first noticeable difference - 
          it has no app.js.  The file is run by index.tsx located within the app folder.

     Business Information was written alongside instructor video "Mobile App Development - Getting Started with 
     React Native Pt. 1 - 2024"

     BusinessCardApp was written by using Business Information - turned it clockwise to turn it to portrait mode.
     Then adjusted to a left side/right side split (1 to 2), then split top to bottom on the left 3 x 1, and the
     right side left as a single unit.

Week 3 : 1/19/25 - 1/25/25

     Added DiceRoller App, written alongside instructor in video Mobile App Development - Getting Started with User Input and 
     Simple State Management Pt. 1 - 2024.
     Added Shopping List week 3 update - written alongside instructor in video Mobile App Development - Getting Started with User Input and 
     Simple State Management Pt. 2 - 2024.
